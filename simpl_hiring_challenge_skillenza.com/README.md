# [simpl](https://getsimpl.com/) hiring challenge solution

It was basically a [Subset Sum problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem)
challenge link: [Simpl | Junior Engineer | Recruitment Drive](https://skillenza.com/challenge/simpl-jr-engineer-rd-jan19)

### skillenza_simpl_junior_engineer.py

1. dist_possible(args): solves using recursive approach
2. dist_possible_2(args): solves using dynamic programming approach

just an observation: approach 1 got 49 out of 100, but approach 0 out of 100 (due to the timeout timer).

### skillenza_simpl_junior_engineer.cpp

Due to slow speed of python, time limits where getting crossed.
So just implemented the same thing in c++ with dynamic programming approach only.
